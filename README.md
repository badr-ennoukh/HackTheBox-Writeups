1. [Devel]
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Description: We solved another machine from Hack The Box. The machine was retired, and its name was Devil. It was a Windows 7 machine. We solved this machine manually, without relying on 
                  automatic methods like Metasploit, which you might have seen in walkthroughs across the internet. We approached the solution differently, hoping that you found something unique in 
                  this walkthrough..
